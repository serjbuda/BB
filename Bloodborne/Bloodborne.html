<strong>Bloodborne</strong> is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by 
Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. It was released worldwide in March 2015.
Bloodborne follows the player's character, a Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian era-inspired city of Yharnam, 
whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal blood-borne disease.
Ultimately attempting to find the source of the plague, the player's character unravels the city's intriguing mysteries while fighting beasts.</br>
The game is played from a third-person perspective. 
Players control a customizable protagonist and the gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and exploration. 
Players battle varied enemies, including bosses, while using items such as swords and firearms as they journey through the story,
 exploring the game's different locations, interacting with non-player characters, collecting key items involved in the story, 
 and discovering and unraveling the world's many mysteries. 
Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast.
Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same developer and director,
Bloodborne was partially inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker, 
and the architectural design of certain real world locations in places such as Romania and the Czech Republic. 
The decision by game director Hidetaka Miyazaki to create a new intellectual property (IP) and not another 
Souls game was made because he wanted to create something "different"; at the same time, 
Sony wanted a new IP to be made exclusively for the PlayStation 4.</br>
Bloodborne received critical acclaim, with praise being directed at its gameplay,
 particularly its high level of difficulty, sound design, atmospheric environments, interconnected world design, and plot. 
 However, some criticism was directed at its technical performance at launch, which was improved with post-release updates. 
An expansion for the game, titled The Old Hunters, was released in November 2015. 
By the end of 2015, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide. 
Bloodborne was nominated for many awards and accolades, and has been cited as one of the greatest video games of all time.

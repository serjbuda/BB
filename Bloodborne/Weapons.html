<div class="content_block"><strong>Weapons</strong> are items that the player 
equips to deal damage, and they are held either exclusively on the left hand 
or the right. Weapons can be as simple as a saw that unfolds into a large 
cleaver, or as complex as a curved sword becoming a large bow.
Weapons do not offer any form of protection, however, as defense is 
governed by the attire worn by players and their ability to dodge and evade.<hr>
<h2>Saw Cleaver</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Saw_Cleaver.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Saw Cleaver is one of the starting weapons presented 
to the player upon arrival to the Hunter's Dream, though 
it may be purchased from the Messengers should the player
acquire the Saw Hunter Badge.
As one of the starting weapons; it, like the Hunter Axe, 
is a Strength-based weapon, though it has almost equal 
scaling of both Skill and Strength like its counterpart, 
the Saw Spear. However, the Saw Cleaver scales more with 
Strength. Additionally, while in its untransformed state 
the Saw Cleaver deals Serration damage, which deals an additional
 20% damage against beast enemies. Similar to the Threaded Cane,
 the Saw Cleaver allows the wielder to utilize a sidearm in both
 untransformed and transformed states.
While in its untransformed mode, the Saw Cleaver's moveset focuses 
primarily on rapid attacks that consume very little stamina per attack.
 However, it also has a short range. Alternatively, while in its transformed 
 mode, the moveset begins to focus on slower, more powerful attacks, and 
 the Saw Cleaver's range increases; however, in its transformed mode, the 
 Saw Cleaver loses its Serration damage bonus. The transformation attacks 
 of the Saw Cleaver are incredibly effective, and one can maintain a high 
 damage-per-second rate by creating a combination of transformation moves.<hr>
<h2>Saw Spear</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Saw_Spear.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Saw Spear is considered by most players to be the superior version 
of the Saw Cleaver. It is made an even more tempting weapon since it 
can be acquired within the first half-hour of the game.
The major differences between these two very similar weapons are:
The Cleaver has slightly higher base damage.
The Cleaver is mostly Strength based, while the Spear is mostly Skill based.
The Cleaver has one mode that deals serrated damage, whereas the Saw Spear 
has both dealing serrated damage.
The Cleaver deals only physical damage, while the Spear also has thrust and
blunt attacks, making its moveset more varied.
In the end the evidence is clear, the Saw Spear is mostly a more versatile option.
Especially because in "Quality" builds (builds with the same amount of 
level investment in both Strength and Skill), both weapons deal essentially 
the same damage.<hr>

<h2>Hunter Axe</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Hunter_Axe.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Hunter Axe is a starting weapon. It is a hand axe in its normal
 state and a halberd (polearm) in its transformed state.
It is often considered one of the best weapons in the game for 
Strength/"Quality" builds. But even at the beginning of the game, 
with low stat investment, it is a good weapon even if players are 
going for a Skill build.
The reason for its popularity is how it has a varied and useful moveset, 
its great damage at the start of the game, the fact some attacks can stagger 
larger opponents, it's transformed state has decent range and it is also 
the weapon with the second highest Rally potential in the game, 
thus allowing players to be more aggressive and save on Blood Vials.
While in its untransformed form, the Hunter Axe has three heavy swings 
followed by a powerful smash in its R1 combo, which allows players to 
attack isolated targets much more quickly, and the charged attack is 
a devastating downward strike that strikes foes into the floor.<hr>
<h2>Threaded Cane</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Threaded_Cane.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Threaded Cane is one of the starting weapons in the game. However, 
unlike its counterparts, the Saw Cleaver and the Hunter Axe, its scaling 
focuses primarily on Skill, with lesser scaling in Arcane and negligible 
scaling in Strength. Like the Saw Cleaver, the Threaded Cane permits the 
user to wield a sidearm, regardless of its state; that is to say, regardless 
of whether it is transformed or not. Additionally, while in its transformed 
state, the Threaded Cane gains an additional 20% damage against beast enemies 
due to the additional Serration damage.
While untransformed, the Threaded Cane possesses a moveset somewhat 
similar to the Reiterpallasch, focusing on rapid attacks with lackluster
 physical damage and short range; alternatively, while transformed, the 
 weapon's moveset becomes slower with more powerful attacks, contributed 
 to by the additional Serration damage, alongside a large increase in the 
 Threaded Cane's range. Finally, when untransformed, the Threaded Cane loses 
 its Serration damage bonus but gains a Righteous damage bonus in its place.<hr>
 <h2>Kirkhammer</h2>
 <img src="Pictures/Weapons/Kirkhammer.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Kirkhammer is known for its extreme dual nature which comprises an 
easy-to-handle silver sword and a huge stone hammer. The sword form allows
 the hunter to perform quick combos that causes slash and thrust damage. 
 While in the transformed form, 
it becomes a greathammer by attaching the sword into its sheath.
Although the hammer is far more powerful than the sword in damage 
and stagger, its slow attack speed and wide radius can lead to the 
wielder being exposed to counter attacks from enemies. Care should 
be taken by the player to position themselves cautiously when in hammer mode.
When used in hammer form this weapon can become cumbersome during 
normal attacks, but when locked on to an enemy its dashing attack 
is the quickest of any trick weapon in the game. This allows the 
wielder the ability to swoop in, deal massive damage, then retreat
 before the enemy has the opportunity to counter attack.
 <hr>
 <h2>Ludwig's Holy Blade</h2>
  <img src="Pictures/Weapons/Ludwig's_Holy_Blade.jpg" class="picture"><p>
It consists of a longsword that, when transformed, 
combines with its sheath to form what is by all rights a Greatsword.
Its Longsword mode possesses the same moveset as the Kirkhammer's 
Longsword mode, with the exception of possessing a much larger blade. 
The similarities increase with the Kirkhammer as its greatsword mode 
deals great damage-albeit less than the Kirkhammer's Great Hammer
mode-but in a much more fluid combo, and without wasting as much stamina.
Additionally, Ludwig's Holy Blade is a Church weapon and is, therefore,
a righteous weapon. It has a 50% damage boost against enemies vulnerable 
to righteous weapons which is active both in primary and secondary modes.
<hr>
<h2>Rifle Spear</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Rifle_Spear.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Rifle Spear is a Trick Weapon that primarily utilizes thrust attacks. 
While not transformed, it is a nondescript spear that almost exclusively
 uses thrust attacks using only one hand, with the exception of a few moves.
 However, the Rifle Spear, while untransformed, possesses limited combos. 
 While transformed, the rifle blade is cocked back and the barrel of a rifle 
 is revealed, while the blade serves as a bayonet. Additionally, the weapon 
 now becomes two-handed. The moveset of the transformed Rifle Spear possesses
 less melee range than the untransformed version and the moves are typically 
 slower. However, the weapon becomes vastly more powerful, especially as the 
 charged attack performs a charging thrust that deals more damage than its 
 untransformed counterpart. Additionally, the Rifle Spear, while transformed, 
 gains access to a plethora of moves outside of basic thrusts, unlike its 
 untransformed counterpart.
 <hr>
 <h2>Stake Driver</h2>
 <img src="Pictures/Weapons/Stake_Driver.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Stake Driver, though it may be short, is definitely on the faster 
side of weapons. It is a good weapon for "quality" builds as it 
has good scaling on both Strength and Skill.
It has two modes: unloaded and loaded.
The "unloaded mode" is the most versatile as its stake is 
pulled out of the mechanism, thus allowing it reach and wide swing. 
It has many combinations of slashing attacks with a single thrust 
attack in its mix, and is overall a very fluid moveset. 
The charged attack, however, is a very brutish downward strike.
The "loaded mode" is perhaps the most straightforward as the stake 
is now fully pulled back into the mechanism of the weapon, 
and players will punch with the weapon repeatedly 
(it is important to note that while in loaded mode all 
of its attacks deal Blunt damage), all attacks are essentially 
based on close-quarters combat. But then comes the strong attack, 
which is what gives this weapon its peculiar name. 
The strong attack fires the stake of the weapon forward, 
effectively being a transformation attack. However, fully 
charging it takes a long while, but creates an explosive, 
devastating blow that completely obliterates opponents, 
with an extremely high damage multiplier.
<hr>
<h2>Tonitrus</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Tonitrus.jpg" class="picture"><p>
Tonitrus is a mace and has a moveset that deals only blunt damage with a 
small innate amount of Bolt damage as well. However, the weapon lacks 
any sort of transformation or change in moveset.
Instead, transforming the Tonitrus charges it with electricity for about
 7 seconds, adding Bolt ATK. In other words, the transformation of this 
 weapon is a temporary Bolt Paper.
However, this buff is quite interesting as it is NOT a flat damage 
boost as other buffs.
This buff, instead, adds a static 40 Bolt damage, then adds a 
0.40 Arcane scaling, and finally multiplies all Bolt damage by a whopping 70%.
The weapon, however, finds balance in its scaling. It has decent scaling 
in Strength and bad Arcane scaling, however, it is versatile in the sense
 that players with high Strength can still get decent damage out of it, 
 especially if they find themselves not having time to buff the weapon, 
 whereas having high Arcane turns it into an extremely high Bolt damage weapon.
 <hr>
 <h2>Blade of Mercy</h2>
 <img src="Pictures/Weapons/Blade_of_Mercy.jpg" class="picture"><p>
 A special trick weapon passed down among hunters of hunters. 
 One of the oldest weapons of the workshop.
Splits into two when activated. The weapon's warped blades are forged with 
siderite, a rare mineral of the heavens. Most effective in swift attacks, 
such as after a quick-stepping.In secondary mode, consecutive weak attacks 
with this weapon continuously increase in speed. These rapid attacks deal 
a lot of damage quickly but will quickly drain stamina at the same time. 
In the transformed state, L2 slices while simultaneously jumping back.
<hr>
<h2>Beast Claw</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Beast_Claw.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Beast Claw has a primary focus on Strength, and is a weapon 
that caters to an extremely aggressive and unique playstyle.
This is because the weapon will permanently activate the Beasthood meter. 
However, the rules of Beasthood still apply, weaker attacks build the meter
slower, while strong attacks build it more quickly, and the player takes 
extra damage while the Beasthood meter is active (Beasthood only boosts 
physical damage, as such do not equip elemental Blood Gems on this weapon.
One of the things that makes it unique is that its moveset can be completely 
changed by equipping the Oath Memory Rune Beast's Embrace.
<hr>
<h2>Chikage</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Chikage.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Chikage is a katana that drains the player's health when transformed 
in exchange for pure Bloodtinge damage and to have a Rapid Poison effect on it.
The health drain is rather slow and is based on percentages. Meaning health 
loss occurs at the same rate regardless of the level of the player’s Vitality.
The Blood Mode deals pure Bloodtinge damage. Bloodtinge damage is extremely 
powerful because it is a damage type that is neither physical nor elemental. 
ost common enemies have high resistances against both physical and Arcane/elemental.
Bloodtinge is something that most enemies only have a moderate resistance. 
Another thing that this weapon has when transformed is the ability to 
effect things with Rapid Poison, this makes it good against bosses or 
enemies who have very low rapid poison defense, such as Bloodlickers 
and Fluorescent Flowers.
<hr>
<h2>Reiterpallasch</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Reiterpallasch.jpg" class="picture"><p>
In its normal form this weapon is a rapier, dealing mostly thrust attacks,
 with the occasional slice. Its strong attack is a horizontal swipe that 
 covers a lot of area in front of the wielder, but, if fully charged, 
 it becomes a powerful thrust.
When transformed, it becomes a Parthian (or "parting shot") Rapier, 
which is shorter, but attacks with quick consecutive sweeps and features 
an attached pistol that fires bullets, replacing the strong attack of the weapon.
It is an effective weapon especially for Skill and Bloodtinge builds.
<hr>
<h2>Whirligig Saw</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Whirligig_Saw.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The  is a very curious weapon. Its one handed mode has 
almost exactly the same attack pattern as the Kirkhammer and Ludwig's 
Holy Blade, albeit that its speed is slower yet has more range. It 
lacks both these weapons ability of dealing "righteous damage" to the 
residents of Cainhurst or the Pthumerians.
The transformed mode of this weapon turns it into an extended buzzsaw,
 complete with a lot of range, damage, and stagger potential. Additionally,
 it has very fluid and natural attacks, and a special attack that is triggered
 by holding the L2 button, this will leave players holding the saw as it cuts
 downs opponents with very fast and consecutive damage.
It also has a terrific Arcane scaling, which is great for players 
focused on elemental builds. Giving it fire damage will turn this 
weapon into an invaluable boon against almost all beasts within the game, 
provided that players have the necessary stats to do so. Additionally, 
the weapon has an above average rallying potential.
<hr>
<h2>Beast Cutter</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Beast_Cutter.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Beast Cutter can be described as a mix between the Saw Cleaver and the 
Threaded Cane.
While in its regular form, the Beast Cutter will act as 
a large cudgel with a rather fluid moveset when compared 
with other mace type weapons. When transformed, it becomes a large, 
bulky whip with the greatest range in the game. Switching up its 
heavy attacks, it performs wide angled slashes to help deal with multiple 
threats at the same time. Additionally, when in whip mode, it can even 
stagger enemies with high poise such as the Winter Lanterns.
Despite all these great advantages, players would do well in 
understanding that this weapon is intended mostly for builds 
with high levels of stamina as regular attacks will consume 
tremendous amounts of it with simple combos. The weapon has 
mediocre scaling even in strength, which it should specialize 
in, and has no hyper-armor unlike other strength based weapons.
<hr>
<h2>Beasthunter Saif</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Beasthunter_Saif.jpg" class="picture"><p>
This weapon is similar in design and appearance of the Saw Cleaver and Saw Spear. 
However, it vastly differs from these weapons both in strategy and practical use. 
While the other weapons are far better at dealing damage to beasts, the 
Beasthunter Saif's maneuverability and swiftness of attacks make it a 
highly versatile weapon. It is ideal for use against other hunters as 
its attacks feature a variety of dodge and dash attacks that quickly close 
distances as well as offer a swift escape.
The primary form is that of a huge curved sword with very wide, slow swings. 
It is great for multiple weak opponents or one slower, harder enemy. 
It is extremely important to understand just how powerful the staggering 
capability of this weapon truly is. In the primary form, it can stagger 
the attacks of a Winter Lantern, making it as effective as Ludwig's Holy Blade 
and the Kirkhammer in their secondary forms.
<hr>
<h2>Boom Hammer</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Boom_Hammer.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Boom Hammer is a weapon that is quite similar in function and strategy 
as the Tonitrus. As such, it is very straightforward.
All of its attacks deal Blunt damage, with a small, yet noticeable amount 
of Fire damage. However, the weapon lacks a transformed state. Instead, 
the player cocks the firing hammer on the Boom Hammer, and it activates 
the miniature furnace within.
This fire buff is permanent, not temporary. From this point, the following 
attack will deal massive fire damage, but only for one hit. This attack 
also deals a small swathe or blast of fire, that can hit enemies with 
its range, potentially hitting or killing multiple opponents. 
Its charge attack is extremely deadly when the buff is active.
This makes the weapon extremely powerful with high chances of 
managing one-hit kills on even enemies with high health. 
And the fire damage is sure to obliterate any Beast-type enemy.
<hr>
<h2>Burial Blade</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Burial_Blade.jpg" class="picture"><p>
he Burial Blade is a trick weapon that turns from a curved sword into a large 
scythe.
The Burial Blade has very wide sweeping attacks, making it an optimal 
weapon for fighting groups of enemies. The small infusion of Arcane 
into the blade adds extra damage to Pthumerians, but is not effective 
against Kin. When transformed, the Burial Blade turns into a complete 
scythe, increasing the attack radius of the weapon, allowing the wielder
 to better deal with multiple opponents and attack them from a safer 
 distance.
This weapon is frequently compared to the Hunter Axe, and for good reason. 
It has a very deceptive reach when transformed and can quickly catch foes 
off guard. It has a very fluid moveset and it has the highest rally 
potential in the game which is further boosted when in scythe mode. 
Another interesting, similar aspect of the Burial Blade is its charge 
attack, as it can knock down heavy enemies like the Merciless Watcher.
Another great thing about it is that the L2 when in scythe mode is a 
combination of multiple, powerful downward thrusts into enemies, making 
it very effective against Kin and Great Ones alike.
In the end, this weapon truly excels at dealing with single or multiple 
enemies and its high rally potential furthers its use especially in 
Cursed Chalice Dungeons where health is extremely important to manage.
<hr>
<h2>Rakuyo</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Rakuyo.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Rakuyo is a pure Skill weapon, with an eventual "A" scaling when fully upgraded, 
has a terrific moveset, and it can be given an element, or buffed.
The untransformed mode is a twin-bladed weapon with an R1 combo comprised 
of slash and thrust attacks one after the other, and the charged strong 
attack is an extremely fast thrust that covers a lot of ground.
The transformed mode separates the weapon as it becomes a dagger 
and katana that have no charged attacks, the R1s are purely combo 
slashes and R2s are purely combo thrusts. The L2 is what makes 
this weapon varied, the wielder will unleash of flurry of spinning slashes. 
It costs a lot of stamina, but can be helpful when surrounded, 
and deals good damage.
However, the L2 attacks change depending on whether there was 
any previous attack, and which attack started the combo sequence. 
With R1, the player will deliver a slower, yet powerful slash with 
both hands into a single direction. With R2, the player will strike 
quickly with both blades in a single thrust.
All of these characteristics make the Rakuyo a very deadly weapon, 
due to its variety of moveset and very fluid movement.
Additionally, since the Rakuyo has a purely Thrust combo with the R2, 
it makes it a very good weapon for fighting Kin type enemies, 
especially as this weapon can be buffed.
<hr>
<h2>Amygdalan Arm</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Amygdalan_Arm.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Amygdalan Arm is undoubtedly one of the best and most versatile dedicated 
Strength weapons in the game.
While on its primary mode, it is merely a curled up limb of an Amygdala 
which can be used to smash opponents into the ground relentlessly. 
The weapon truly comes to life (figuratively and literally) when its 
secondary mode is activated, turning it into a deadly whip that can 
strike multiple times using its previously retracted talon.
The Club form should be used primarily against single opponents, 
as it is faster and saves more stamina. However, attacks are 
without much variety. All weak attacks are overhead bashes that 
crash into the ground, with the last one having a delay from a 
spin the character does. The strong attack will do a wide horizontal 
swing, but when charged will crash into the ground with great strength, 
knocking opponents into the pavement. Continuing the strong attack 
afterwards will launch enemies flying into the air. This strong
 attack combo is so powerful that it can be used as a 
 replacement for Visceral Attacks should the player hit 
 them from the back. The running weak attack is a horizontal 
 swing and the strong attack is an upward vertical swing. 
 Both weak and strong back-step attacks are blunt thrusts 
 with different speeds and damage. The dashing weak attack is a regular bash.
 <hr>
<h2>Kos Parasite</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Kos_Parasite.jpg" class="picture"><p>
While the weapon appears to be the Hunter's bare fists at first, using it 
in tandem with the Milkweed rune reveals its true form; that of many 
tentacles sprouting from the Hunter's right hand, with more tentacles 
emerging from the left hand when the weapon is transformed.
The Kos Parasite is a singular weapon for many reasons. 
The most obvious is that it deals solely Arcane damage. 
It has also the highest stat requirement in Arcane for Trick Weapons.
When it comes to its attacks, they are all very slow, 
with very awkward stumbling on part of the player, 
yet do not be fooled, as every attacks deals a lot of damage and stagger.
Additionally, it has multiple strange moves such as whipping a tongue-like 
tentacle that sprouts from the player's head, a spit back step attack 
that deals Slow Poison, and a special move that creates multiple bursts 
of Arcane Blasts within a certain radius, which deal tremendous amounts 
of damage. At high levels of Arcane, players can often one-shot other 
players with this move alone, and since it is an area of effect attack, 
it can kill multiple opponents at once.
<hr>
<h2>Logarius' Wheel</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Logarius'_Wheel.jpg" class="picture"><p>
Weapon wielded by martyr Logarius' band of executioners.
Used to slaughter the Vilebloods in Cainhurst. Bathed in pools of their blood, and forever steeped in their ire.
Transform to release the power of the wheel and manifest their lingering rage in a show of utter brilliance.
While transformed, Logarius' Wheel's damage changes; the Strength and Arcane scalings are swapped, netting a C in Strength and an S in Arcane.
The transformed wheel can be self-buffed by pressing L2.
The wheel can be buffed three times.
Each buff adds 10% arcane damage and a health drain of 0.1%.
The second buff is weaker than the first, but the third buff is the strongest.
The buff lasts roughly 30-35 seconds.
You can reapply buffs to the weapon, but the buffs will start again from the first. This means that you must reapply three buffs to reach the third level again.
The health drained by the buffs can be regained through combat, unlike the health drained by the Chikage.
The buffs do not affect the transformation attack.
<hr>
<h2>Bloodletter</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Bloodletter.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Bloodletter is the only other weapon, besides the Chikage, to use 
the wielder's health to transform into its second form. However, while 
the latter drains the wielder's health constantly, the Bloodletter will 
only drain a certain amount of health every time the player transforms 
into its secondary mode. Depending on the wielder's intentions and 
fighting style, this will be either an advantage or disadvantage over the Chikage.
Most importantly, just like the Chikage, the secondary form will scale entirely 
with the Bloodtinge stat, which makes this weapon its Strength equivalent.
Another interesting feature of the Bloodletter is that its special attack when 
two-handed will deal a high damage area of effect blood explosion. Unfortunately, 
the area of the blast is small and the wielder will induce Frenzy on themselves. 
The amount of frenzy is not very large and players who boost their Frenzy Resist 
can use the special attack three times in a row without triggering Frenzy damage. 
Unlike standard Frenzy damage, Frenzy damage through this weapon will lower the 
player's health by 50% instead of the standard 75%.
<hr>
<h2>Church Pick</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Church_Pick.jpg" class="picture"><p>
This weapon is indeed a must for any players that focus on Skill. 
Not only is it the only weapon that deals pure Thrust damage in one 
of its modes, it actually deals Serrated and Righteous damage in both modes.
This makes it good for killing Kin, Beasts, and enemies of the Healing Church. 
It is the only weapon in the game to do so. In fact, as if that weren't enough, 
the moveset of both modes is also good. With fast and fluid attacks that easily 
stagger opponents and a special attack that, when two-handed, costs less stamina 
and pokes extremely quickly at foes with less damage but with the potential to 
break their combos.
<hr>
<h2>Holy Moonlight Sword</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Holy_Moonlight_Sword.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Holy Moonlight Sword is a very interesting weapon to say the least. 
While it has great physical stats and Arcane Stats, its moveset is great in 
almost every way.
In its base Greatsword form it has a medium speed of attack with mostly wide, 
long ranged swings, whereas the strong attacks are useful thrusts, capable of 
getting opponents who like to keep their distance. The charge attack itself 
is a powerful thrust with a strong followup, underhead swing, knocking most 
opponents off their feet, much like the Saw Spear's charge attack in its spear 
state.
When transformed it has added Arcane damage. Every strong attack will expend a 
Quicksilver Bullet while throwing an Arcane wave at an enemy. Its special 
two-handed attack is an explosive thrust, a great move as even when 
thrusting in a certain direction, the player will burst with energy 
around his body. So even if maximum damage is not achieved, at least 
enemies won't be able to flank you.
<hr>
<h2>Simon's Bowblade</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Simon's_Bowblade.jpg" class="picture"><p>
Simon's Bowblade is a curved sword with a flowing moveset that becomes a greatbow 
upon transforming it, thus making a player wield it in their left hand, with an 
arrow on their right. Nocking an arrow will cost a single Quicksilver Bullet.
While the weapon is quite similar to the Reiterpallasch and the Rifle Spear in 
terms of combat strategy, its main property is not to parry enemies mid attack, 
but rather to inflict a lot of damage. The weapon's transformed mode has the 
potential to deal the most damage per shot in terms of firearms, despite not 
being a firearm itself. However, this comes at the cost of expending stamina 
as nocking arrows consumes far more stamina than pulling a trigger. Its 
charged attack allows a player to nock an arrow in place longer and thus 
grants it higher damage. This attack will consume more stamina and the player 
will be stationary for a brief moment. It is advised to use this attack 
carefully. One can backstab from a distance with the charged bow R2.
It is of great importance to learn the range at which this weapon can 
be fired because just like any other firearm, the projectile quickly 
disappears after a certain distance.
<hr>
<h2>Hunter Pistol</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Hunter_Pistol.jpg" class="picture"><p>
This weapon fires Quicksilver Bullets and is used as tool for parrying and finishing off enemies with 
low health. Its rapid fire makes it more suitable for intercepting fast enemies than shotguns.
The Hunter Pistol is a versatile firearm commonly used by hunters. Although the Hunter 
Pistol doesn't quite have the firepower or stagger potential of the Hunter Blunderbuss (depends on range), it compensates for this problem by having a higher fire rate and longer range.
When compared with other pistol-sized firearms, it has the following characteristics:
Consumes only one bullet, like the Evelyn, yet unlike the Repeating Pistol (keep in mind that the Repeating Pistol also fires off two shots at once, whereas the Hunter Pistol only fires one).
Same range, firing speed, and Quicksilver bullet consumption as the Evelyn.
Better than the Evelyn at lower levels of Bloodtinge. After level 21 in that stat, the Evelyn becomes a straight upgrade in terms of damage.

<hr>
<h2>Hunter Blunderbuss</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Hunter_Blunderbuss.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Hunter Blunderbuss uses 1 Quicksilver Bullet per shot. However, it 
applies the shot into a shotgun-like spray. 
The widespread of this weapon can stagger multiple enemies at one time, 
as well as knock enemies back.
The damage per shot is generally less than the Pistol, as many of the shots 
are likely to miss, although at higher upgrade levels the blunderbuss can 
do more damage.
It has a slower fire rate than the Hunter Pistol.
<hr>
<h2>Repeating Pistol</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Repeating_Pistol.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Repeating Pistol is a firearm that consumes two Quicksilver Bullets per shot.
Although this weapon does not have the amazing Bloodtinge scaling of the Evelyn, it does 
surpass it in damage, making it the most powerful pistol in the game, but at the cost of consuming twice as much ammunition. 
It still has the same firing speed and range as other pistols.
This firearm is less fit for parries, and more for doing purely raw damage. 
It is already powerful in the hands of players with low Bloodtinge, 
but it becomes even more dangerous if players have it higher.
<hr>
<h2>Ludwig's Rifle</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Ludwig's_Rifle.jpg" class="picture"><p>
Ludwig's Rifle has the same range of the Hunter Pistol and the same spread 
of the Hunter Blunderbuss. 
It is, however, much slower in terms of fire rate.
In terms of damage, it is quite deadly, but only at close ranges. 
It is the most powerful Blunderbuss type weapon until level 30 of Bloodtinge. 
Beyond that point, the Hunter Blunderbuss is the most powerful. As such, 
Ludwig's Rifle is the best for low Bloodtinge builds.
<hr>
<h2>Cannon</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Cannon.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Cannon is the highest damaging firearm in the game, being capable 
of killing most enemies with only one shot outright. Each use, however, 
will consume 12 Quicksilver Bullets as of patch v1.03. This is to 
counterbalance its insanely high damage. Bone Marrow Ash may be used 
to further increase its damage and "one-shot" potential.
In PVP, this weapon shines as players can easily kill 
other hunters just as easily as any other beast in the game. 
It will, however, be much harder since players tend to dodge 
and have an actual reaction to players who use this weapon in PVP.
Players have strategized using this weapon in combination with the 
Reiterpallasch to be able to parry with the right hand, and shoot the 
parried player with the Cannon, as it will often deal much more damage 
than a regular visceral attack, and killing the player instantly. 
This strategy holds effective, and true to almost any other enemy in PVE, 
especially in bosses within the Chalice Dungeons.

<h2>Church Cannon</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Church_Cannon.jpg" class="picture"><p>
It has lower base damage than the Cannon (480 base damage when fully upgraded, 
compared with the 600 of the Cannon), as well as lower QS Bullet consumption 
(only 10 instead of 12). It also has a slightly lower strength requirement, 
but has a Bloodtinge requirement instead of Skill.
There is an arc to its shot, which explodes only upon impact 
instead of exploding in mid-air. The Church Cannon also reloads faster 
than the regular Cannon.

<h2>Evelyn</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Evelyn.jpg" class="picture"><p>
The Evelyn is best described by comparing it with the starting Hunter Pistol. 
It is essentially the same gun with the same overall stats, nothing different 
whatsoever save for two things: the base damage of this pistol is much lower, while 
the scaling is much higher.
This translates to a pistol that caters to players who wish to focus on Bloodtinge. 
And sure enough, beyond level 20 in Bloodtinge, the Evelyn will outdamage the 
Hunter Pistol.
However, regardless of build, the Repeating Pistol is the one that always has the 
most damage, while also having the greater cost per trigger pull.

<h2>Piercing Rifle</h2>
<img src="Pictures/Weapons/Piercing_Rifle.jpg" class="picture"><p>
This firearm is essentially a rifle version of the Hunter Pistol, with the 
added effect of being able to pierce through multiple opponents. As mentioned 
before, it has almost identical stats and scaling to the Hunter Pistol, but 
the firing and recovery speed of Ludwig's Rifle.
This makes it especially useful for high Bloodtinge builds when fighting hordes 
of very weak enemies, a prime example would be in Old Yharnam or within 
Chalice Dungeons, especially since it will save many bullets. In order to 
make full use of the rifle, the player should try to bunch enemies together 
in a small, narrow area in order to hit as many of them with a single shot as 
possible.
It can also prove useful in PvP should a co-operator try to block shots with 
its body to prevent the host from taking damage.
